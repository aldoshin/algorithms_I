Union Find
-----------------
Makes use of __Weighted quick-union__: Rather than arbitrarily connecting the second tree to the first for union() in the quick-union algorithm, we keep track of the size of each tree and always connect the smaller tree to the larger. Program WeightedQuickUnionUF.java implements this approach


The solution for Percolation does not deal with backwash


The Subset handles the case where the maximum size of RandomizedQueue object created is <= k by randomizing the array of string

Fast in collinear avoids subsets.
